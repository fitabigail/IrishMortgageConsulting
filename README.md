# Introduction
This project is the second one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitutE.net).
It is a website about mortgages through brokers. The mortgage broker offers advice to the user about the requirements in relation to obtaining a mortgage and guides him through the mortgage application process. The user is able to build a picture of the future mortgage using a handy calculator to determine how much will be his repayments, the cost of the mortgage, and the total amount to be paid. Also, they have the option to book a meeting through a Booking Form to meet with one of the team members to have in-depth knowledge of the mortgage.
For general questions and office contact they can rich the Contact Us page which is the office address with email and phone number, and a Contact Form with input fields for name, email, and message.

### Design

  
  
  #### Colour Scheme 


 
  I tried different color palettes whilst building the website and settled on a simple combination of shades of orange, grey, white, and black.
  Black and white are used for text color and contrast well with the other two primary colors. Default Orange was used for the link color on hover, and for buttons. Different shades of white, grey, and orange were used for the backgrounds.
  - grey : hsla(0, 8%, 5%, 0.9), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); rgba(7, 6, 6, 0.925); rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
  - white: antiquewhite, aliceblue ;
  - orange: #ce5713,  #8f2b04;


   #### Typography


  I choose 'Playfair Display' as the font for the site. The headers and forms on all pages throughout the Website are using 'Oswald' font.

   #### Wireframes

  <summary>Features</summary>
  
  ### Responsive  Website

   The site displays properly at a wide range of screen sizes, further information on this is listed in the testing section. 



              



  ### HOME Page

### Navbar

   - A feature on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes a link to Logo, Home page, Calculator page and Contact Us page and is identical on each page to allow easy navigation. On page loading, the navigation bar drops down smoothly to catch up user's attention. On the left side, the navbar has the logo linked to the Home page, and on the right side is the hamburger menu. On mouse click, the hamburger is switching to an arrow and a full-screen page is loading with the page's links, a feature achieved with javascript code.




### Section one - the landing

  - This section includes several different CSS animations on the loading page. This includes a big animated banner with two titles business-related subject, a welcome title, and a discover button with a shine effect linked with the Calculator page.
   ![HOME PAGE](./assets/readmeImages/landing-banner.png)

### About section
 
- About section include a video with custom control, achieved with javascript code. Clicking the video button will start the video, and a bar will roll. If press the pause button the video will stop playing. The video is displayed for screens of 550px and wider.

![HOME PAGE](./assets/readmeImages/about.png)

### Team section

- This section shows the profile cards of the three members team. When hovering the card some information about the member will appear with a nice and cool hoover effect, the cards move smoothly with the cursor direction. This effect was achieved by calling JQuery CDN tools for the plugin tilt.js.

### Responsiveness
  
   Media queries based on screen width were used to ensure the page was displayed correctly across a range of screen sizes.
  Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers were used to test responsiveness.  
  
  Breakpoints used are as follows 320px, 391px, 460px, 549px, 550px, 560px, 650px,760px, 768px, 950px, 991px, 1250px, 1450px, 1500px, 1650px, 1920px and 2200px. 

 I also used the device-specific tool within Chrome, Edge, and Media Genesis (https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) to test a number of devices representing a wide range of device types.    
  The results are given below.

  |Device                 |  Result        |

 ### Issues Encountered Building The Site

A brief summary of some of the difficulties I had building this site and how I attempted to fix them. 

 
 + Cards info in the Our Team section of the landing page had text which was not illegible when hovered over. I fixed this issue by setting different opacity.
 + On smaller devices much of the text was illegible due to its font size, I have redefined all the media queries;
 +  Contact Us form was potentially inaccessible as the form only appeared in the hover state. I fixed this by canceling the flipping card view.
 + The contact form itself could be submitted without the user providing a supporting message. I fixed this issue by writing a proper javascript code with validation and a submitting message.
 + User was able to enter invalid or empty data in forms. Fixed by javascript validation code;
 + Errors in console while page loads/performing user actions ON CONTACT US page. Fixed by removing  any javascript code not related to the page;
 + The mortgage calculator, allowed negative figures to be input leading to nonsensical outputs. Fixed by adding a javascript code on inputs on Html; 
 + I had many problems positioning the text div from the Calculator page and fixed them using different percentages for 'font-size', width, and height set on vh to get them to satisfactorily position on different devices.
 + The chart pie cause me trouble with different devices size, as had a predefined style. I changed the width and height of the canvas Html element and adapted it to different screen sizes.
 + The checked box from Booking put me in difficulty as I tried to set the konb and was not fit on the right spot. So I decide to get already written code and adapted it to my site style, which worked well only the Html validator did not allow div as a child of a label so I replaced and fixed the error with a span element.
 + On the booking form submit button click more ap a message to the user and should return to the Calculator page. I write the function myBooking() to write the alert message and return to the page. The function was not working as I used the form action attribute from the w3 web page for testing examples. Now I know no need for an action attribute if I have a function to call.
+ I had to become familiar with many new (to me) CSS properties such as transform-origin, transform-style, backface-visibility, and perspective. 

### Manual Testing for Bugs

Testing is required on the Irish MortgageConsulting Responsive Website.

The project is developed primarily using HTML and CSS, with a small amount of JavaScript implemented for additional functionality.
The testing performed will be on the back end and front end. Testing is to be done on at least three web browsers and all screen sizes.
All navigation links should direct to the correct Html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html. 

All links to external websites must open in a new browser.

Testing of form validation will also be required to ensure the correct inputs are taken and that all fields are required. 

The live Project can be found [here](https://fitabigail.github.io/IrishMortgageConsulting/).</br>

### Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing

- booking form after closing message alert was not redirected to calculator page, issue fixed;
- the contact form did not send the email with the message, the plugin used https://smtpjs.com/ required an SMTP server and I couldn't use my elastic email host account https://elasticemail.com/ because the domain must be verified. Us the gitpod domain name is not owned it can not be verified; 

### Issues Remaining (Known to me)

+ There is a large space over the Home and Calculator page. This issue  I have tried to fix but still have some space, but because of the short time, I will leave this for another time.
+ The bottom height of the calculator background increases once the  device size is decreasing;
+ The Booking and Contact Us for could post the data to a server. This feature I will leave this for future development;
+ On mobile view test to my iPhone 12 and Samsung galaxy s10 the Booking form has an error as first it doesn't show the title of the pattern, so the user does not know the name field has only a letter message, second after inputs the form it does not fit on the section and is difficult to scroll over form;
+ On the footer section, the copyright paragraph on flex display is not on the same line as others. I will fix this in the future;
+ The pie chart should reset with the new amount and interest pie when inputting values into the mortgage amount field. At this stage, the pie chart is updated on changes in the years and interest values;
